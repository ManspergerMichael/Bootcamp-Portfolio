        <p>Today I will blog about my constant blogging. I blog for hours until hunger pains shoot up my spine and I lose consciousness. 
            This is bad because I can't blog for several hours. I've purchaced an IV bag so nutrients can be fed to me introveniously while I blog</p>
        <p>Other things I blog about.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blogging</li>
            <li>Vlogging</li>
            <li>Flogging</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I came to the conclusion that people will pay me to not blog. This will not stop me though. Ive got plenty of money from the Facebook lawsuit where I proved they got me addicted to blogging.</p>
